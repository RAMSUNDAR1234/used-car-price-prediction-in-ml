# used-car-price-prediction-in-ml
Welcome to the Used Car Price Prediction repository! This project demonstrates how to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the prices of used cars based on various features. The repository includes code and resources for building and optimizing models using multiple machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.

Project Overview:

In this project, we explore several machine learning models to forecast used car prices with accuracy and efficiency. The core focus is on preprocessing data, selecting and tuning models, and evaluating their performance.

Key Techniques and Models Used
Data Preprocessing:

Scaling and Normalization: Applied techniques to standardize feature values and ensure consistent model performance.
Feature Engineering: Enhanced and created new features to improve the predictive power of the models.
Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest: Utilized for its robustness and ability to handle various data complexities.
Gradient Boosting: Employed to enhance prediction accuracy through iterative learning and boosting.
Linear Regression: Implemented as a baseline model to assess the impact of linear relationships between features and target variables.

Results
The project provides a comprehensive comparison of the selected machine learning models, showcasing their performance in predicting used car prices. Detailed results and performance metrics are available in the Jupyter notebooks.
